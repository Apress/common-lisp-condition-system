# Contributing

The sources are split into sources for the first part of the book and the appendices (the [`Sources - TCLCS`](Sources%20-%20TCLCS/) folder) and sources for Portable Condition System (PCS, the [`Sources - PCS`](Sources%20-%20PCS/) folder). Note that the sources for PCS are for version 1.1.0 of the library and will not be updated here; for contributing to PCS, please see [the main repository of the project](https://github.com/phoe/portable-condition-system).

If you'd like to contribute to the TCLCS part:

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
2. Fork the repository for the relevant book.
3. Create a new branch on which to make your change, e.g.
`git checkout -b my_code_contribution`
4. Commit your change. Include a commit message describing the correction. Please note that if your commit message is not clear, the correction will not be accepted.
5. Submit a pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!
