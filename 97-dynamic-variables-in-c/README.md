# Dynamic variables in C - examples

This directory is structured in the following manner:
* `./header/`: different implementations of dynamic variables in C.
* `./include/`: examples that make use of dynamic variables.
* `./`: buildable C files.

The goal is to have one buildable C file for each combination of `header` and `include`.

To build all examples, issue `make` in this directory. TODO
