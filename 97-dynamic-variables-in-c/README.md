# Dynamic variables in C - examples

This directory is structured in the following manner:
* `./dynavars/`: different implementations of dynamic variables in C.
* `./examples/`: examples that make use of dynamic variables.
* `./`: buildable C files.

The goal is to have one buildable C file for each combination of `dynavars` and `examples`.

To compile each example, call `gcc` on each `.c` file in this directory.
